			<h3>Exercise 4</h3>
			<p>Write a program of your own design using your typeface as a framework. Consider logical operators such as: 'if', & 'else'; as well as conditional operations such as: 'is', & 'is not'. First: what does your program "do"? What does it not do? What conditions must be met to make it excute correctly?</p>
