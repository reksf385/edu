            <p>In this work, three stones are spaced on top of a five-meter rubber measuring tape laid out on the floor. Each of the tape’s linear segments is distorted so that a one meter segment is stretched to three meters, and two meters stretched to two-and-a-half meters. Stones thus act as markers that deform the given rules of linear measurement, introducing a moment of uncertainty in the precise universe of measurement that questions the divisibility of space. Measurement is no longer conceived as reliant on mathematical constancy, but as a variable model contingent upon perception. From MoMA.</p>

        <h3>Project 1: Part 1 (in class)</h3>
        <p>Choose a space nearby to explore. The space may be as small as a closet or as large as a classroom. Begin by making a list of the intended functions of the space. If there are alternative ways to use the space separate from its intended use, list those as well. Observe how you move through the space and think about how your presence in the space activates its functions. Once you have considered all possible functions of the space, organize them in order of intended uses down to alternative uses. Write out the procedure for carrying out each function. Thoroughly document the space and each function using photography. Finally, construct a brief slide presentation that explains the space in an efficient and poetic manner.</p>

        <h3>Project 1: Part 2</h3>
        <p>Create 5 proposals for a website that represents your space.
           Choose a minimum of three functions or
           actions within the space to represent. The
           way the user navigates your website should
           relate to the way one moves through
           your chosen space. While designing,
           ask yourself the following: What is an
           appropriate navigation for the space? What
           does it look like? How are the functions
           of the space expressed visually and how
           do they relate to/depart from the physical
           act of performing the function within the
           space? Is my position interesting? How
           does the way the user navigates the
           website relate to the subject? Are the
           formal qualities of the website intentional
           and appropriate? Is it beautiful?</p>

        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>Create a favicon for the Core Interaction website. Think about the function of the website along with the navigational and formal elements of its design. How does the favicon you design relate to these elements?</p>
